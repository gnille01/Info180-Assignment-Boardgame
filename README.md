# Info180-Boardgame
Group project in which we added an AI-player and integrated it to the program to play against the professors player.

For this assignment our professor provided us with a finished code of a Zero-sum-game, with a computerplayer and functionality to play agianst it. 
We were tasked to finish the programme by adding another computerplayer so we could simulate the two Ai's playing against eachother.
Preferably our new computerplayer should be better than the original 'simple' one. When running the program it simulates several games, and counts the scores of each player. In pretty much every simulation, the new player wins the majority of games.

To start the simulation, run the game through the 'main.py' tab.
